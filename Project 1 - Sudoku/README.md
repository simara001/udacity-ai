# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree
## Introductory Project: Diagonal Sudoku Solver

# Question 1 (Naked Twins)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem?  
A: The same way I used elimination and only option techniques. The algorithm tries to reduce the puzzle (or solve it) in iterations.
As you can see:

```python
def reduce_puzzle(values):
    stalled = False
    while not stalled:
        # Getting solved values before applying eliminate/only choice/naked twins techniques
        solved_values_before = len([box for box in values.keys() if len(values[box]) == 1])
        # Applying techniques
        values = eliminate(values)
        values = only_choice(values)
        values = naked_twins(values)
```

I have combined the 3 different techniques in each iteration so I can propagate the constrains of each one of them, until
the algorithm finds what we are looking for (single values for all the boxes).

# Question 2 (Diagonal Sudoku)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the diagonal sudoku problem?  
A: The most important part is understanding how `unit_list` influences all the techniques. Let's remember that `unit_list`
is the variable that contains the constraints for our algorithm. Initially, it was only the combination of:

```python
unit_list =  column_units + row_units + square_units
```

I calculated the new 2 constraints and include them on unit_list:

```python
# Getting diagonal values (we can hardcode it also i.e. ['A1','B2','C3'...]
diagonal_left = [[r+c for r,c in zip(rows,cols)]]
diagonal_right = [[r+c for r,c in zip(rows,cols[::-1])]]
unit_list =  column_units + row_units + square_units + diagonal_left + diagonal_right
```

After that, `peers` will add another 2 arrays (diagonals), and the technicques that use peers for back propagating 
constraints will take the new constraints (diagonals) in consideration
